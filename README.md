# MMFeedbacks Extensions
==========================

MMFeedbacks is a useful asset for constructing and configuring various behaviors in response to events.  Easily extensible with additional feedbacks, this repository injects a set feedbacks directly, and provides easy access to additional sets for other integration with other assets.

### Updating
To update, open Packages/manifest.json and remove the com.realitystop.MMFeedbacks entry under lock at the end of the file.

## Installing individual asset packs

While the main pack installs universally applicable feedbacks, additional feedbacks can be installed depending on what 3rd party assets are part of the project via the use of Package Manager Samples.  (The exact samples list may have changed since screenshots were taken)
